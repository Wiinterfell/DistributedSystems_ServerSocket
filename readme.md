# Python MultiThread Echo Server Socket

## Description

This is a python code to open a socket and talk to [this type of client](https://github.com/Wiinterfell/DistributedSystems_ClientSocket). It is a simple echo client in Python.
This server opens a new thread for each new client connection. Moreover, I used the [thread pool pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool) to keep control of my running threads number.

## Scripts

The project can be run with the following command : start.sh portnumber
